jView is a prototype for JavaScript view objects that subclasses the jQuery.fn
prototype. A jView is essentially a wrapper for a single element, usually a div,
with the following special properties:

- jView instances may have custom events bound to them using jQuery's native
  events subsystem and the familiar bind/one/unbind/trigger mechanism
- jView instances try to keep track of their superview

Also, jView prototypes may easily be extended to support complex view class
hierarchies.

The code is purely experimental at this point, so no guarantees.
